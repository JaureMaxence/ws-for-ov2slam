[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Threads)
  does not match the name of the calling package (ecl_threads).  This can
  lead to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result
  variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

  By not providing "Findkobuki_core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project

  "kobuki_core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "kobuki_core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
