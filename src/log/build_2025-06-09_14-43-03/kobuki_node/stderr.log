[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (Threads)
  does not match the name of the calling package (ecl_threads).  This can
  lead to problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result
  variables (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findkobuki_core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "kobuki_core", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "kobuki_core" with
  any of the following names:

    kobuki_coreConfig.cmake
    kobuki_core-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "kobuki_core" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "kobuki_core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "kobuki_core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
